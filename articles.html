<h3>Summary of Certain CARGO CONNECT Articles Read</h3>

<h4> Article: Paper Packager Ranpak Packs a Punch—and So Could Its Stock </h4>
<h4>
Author: Al Root, Barron's
</h4>

<ul>

	<li>
	Ranpak Holdings has seen its shares plunge 18% in the 
	past four weeks. The Ohio-based company is the leader in protective 
	paper packaging, a fast-growing, environmentally friendly alternative to bubble wrap. 
	With a market value of $2.8 billion, Ranpak business 
	carries three big trends: sustainability, e-commerce, and automation. 
    </li>

	<li>
	Its main business is specialized paper wrapping 
	and cushioning for shipments, or what it calls 
	“in-the-box paper-based technologies and products.” 
	The market for protective packaging is $8 billion. 
	Today, bubble wrap, foam, and bags filled 
	with air account for fully $7 billion of the market.
</li>

<li>
	There is a real problem with plastic pollution.  Only a 
	fraction of the roughly 400 million tons of plastic 
	produced each year gets recycled. Paper, by contrast, 
	is biodegradable, and most of the paper used by Ranpak gets recycled six to eight times.
</li>

<li>
	The U.S. parcel market is headed to 134 million 
	packages a day by 2026, up 70% from 2020, according 
	to FedEx.  Just about anything that is shipped—from 
	wine glasses to car parts—requires protective packaging.
</li>

</ul>

<h4> Article: Recycling Isn’t as Clear-Cut as You Might Think
</h4>
<h4>
Author: Jo Craven McGinty, Wall Street Journal
</h4>


<ul>

<li>
As demand for plastics has grown, so has concern over the waste.
  More than 90% of plastics generated in the U.S. each 
  year winds up in landfills or incinerators, according 
  to the Environmental Protection Agency. Only about 9% 
  is recycled.  Plastics that have the potential to be 
  recycled are stamped with a triangle made of three arrows 
  enclosing a resin-identification code—a digit from 1 to 7
   that indicates the type of plastic—but the presence of 
   the emblem doesn’t guarantee the waste will be reused, even if it makes it into a recycling bin.
</li>

<li>
Recycled aluminum has a 100% yield.   Cardboard 
can be recycled seven or eight times. Plastic has 
a yield loss of about 20%. If I sell you 100 tons
 of plastics, you’re going to be able to capture and use 80 tons.
</li>

</ul>

<h4>
	Article: The Parcel Shipping Boom Continues
</h4>
<h4>
	Author: Katharina Buchholz, Statista
</h4>

<ul>
	<li>
	Parcel shipping is a booming business, relying on 
	e-commerce shoppers for increased volume and revenues.
	While the coronavirus pandemic brought about another
	boost for global parcel volumes, figures by mailing
	services company Pitney Bowes suggest growth in the sector 
	already followed a steep trajectory previously.  
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>
	Article: Turn Your Shipping Box into A Competitive Advantage
</h4>
<h4>
Author: Brent Hughes, Forbes
</h4>

<ul>
	<li>
	A good unboxing experience can give your business 
	free marketing. Unboxing videos are videos of people 
	opening products and providing a real-world view. 
	In an unboxing video, the product is stripped down 
	to an experience more in line with reality. Customers
	 get a real sense of your product without actually 
	 having to buy it. Lots of customers said that watching
	  online unboxing videos had helped them choose a specific product or brand.

<h4>
	Article: The Packaging Mistakes Companies Make—and Why They Make Them 
</h4>
<h4>
Author:	Kate Murphy, Wall Street Journal
</h4>

<ul>
	<li>
	Packaging can be a neglected aspect, if not an idle afterthought, 
	of product development. Now the vast majority of people say the 
	design and materials used to package a product influence their 
	buying decisions. Of particular concern is excessive packaging—the
	 kind that makes you feel like a one-person climate menace toting
	  all the leftover cardboard, plastic and Styrofoam to the trash.
	</li>
	<li>
It’s a balancing act. People want less packaging, and yet they want 
the product to arrive in good condition. They want packages that
 are practical and sustainable but also spark joy. They want
  a package that informs (ingredients, directions, use-by date), 
  but they also don’t want to be overwhelmed with verbiage.
</li>
