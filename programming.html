    <h1>General Programming Strategy</h1>
	<br>
		<ul>
			<li>We use various functions to run our programs 
				(so we can reuse code and change 
			parameters, as required)</li>
			
			<li>We have created a selection program
			which allows us to quickly and efficiently 
			choose missions (or even re-run missions 
			quickly) during matches. Audible sounds 
			and meaningful EV3 screen messages allow 
			the user to select programs with ease</li>
			
			<li>By using gear lash removal before each 
			movement, the acceleration and deceleration movements when starting
			and stopping a movement, our own 
			error-corrected move block, and Proportional Integral Derivative
			line following, we are able to achieve more consistent and repeatable
			robot movement</li>
			
			<li>We regularly use functions, also known as subroutines, which allows us
			to reuse code whenever possible and to keep
			our program sizes manageable.
			</li>
			
			<li>We annotate our work to help us
			debug programs and to better understand
			the purpose of each line of code</li>
			
			<li>We make frequent use of our square up 
			function which allows the robot to position 
			itself perpendicularly to any line (from
			virtually any angle of attack)</li>
			
			<li>Our functions and parameters are given 
			descriptive and meaningful names to allow 
			us to easily understand what our programs 
			are doing</li>
			
			<li>Within all of our major movement
			functions (such as our error-corrected move block and PID line following block),
			we have a function inside that is constantly 
			checking if a certain exit condition is met.
			When that exit condition is met, the program
			immediately exits that loop causing the robot to 
			advance to the next robot maneuver. For example, stop
			the robot when one of the light sensors a black
			line.</li>
			
			<li>Our "Check-Abort" function constantly checks 
			whether the EV3 up arrow button is pressed.   
			The robot operator can interrupt missions at any time and
			still stay within the overall selection program 
			to avoid the need to exit the program and find 
			the next program or mission.</li>
			
			<li>When accelerating from a stationary position,
			our robot uses Ctrl-Z-designed acceleration and deceleration feature s
			to minimize the likelihood of wheel slip. 
			This provides for greater repeatability of 
			the robotâ€™s movements.</li>
			
			<li>As well, instead of using standard calibrated
			values, we use raw light sensor values for more
			granularity. Our calibration program collects the
			lowest and highest light readings the robot would 
			see. Then, based on those, we scale any light
			readings to a usable range where 0 is black and 
			100 is white.</li>
		
		</ul>

		<br>
		<h1>Program Hierarchy</h1>
		<br>
		<p>In the interest of maximizing programming efficiency, we use subroutines whenever possible.
			Subroutines are used for typical robot movements, like line following, squaring to a line,
			error-corrected movements, etc., as well as for entire missions.
			The use of subroutines allows us to re-use programming code and enjoy the benefits of an
			efficient mission selection program. This diagram to the left illustrates the great extent
			to which Ctrl-Z re-uses programming code.

		<h1>Function Examples</h1>
		<br>
	
		<h3>Main Selection Program</h3>

		<p>This selection program allows us to quickly and 
		efficiently switch programs/missions 
		during the two-and-a-half minute match. 
		Our selection program contains functions, each containing one of our missions.
		The user of the robot simply starts the selection 
		program and clicks the centre button to start the first
		mission. Then, when the mission finishes, the robot 
		automatically advances to the next mission and waits for
		the user to click the centre button to run the appropriate mission.
		In case one needs to go backwards or 
		forwards through the list of missions, the program 
		accommodates that by allowing the user to navigate 
		with the left and right arrow buttons.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Square Up</h3>
		<p>We have created a function that makes the robot completely perpendicular to the edge of a black line.
		Each light sensor corresponds with a motor. The robot drives up to the line and has the light sensor check the
		reflected light values. If the light sensor sees a value of less than 50 (black), it will tell the motor to move
		towards a value greater than 50 (white). It does this for both motors while for a set amount of time while slowly decreasing in power,
		until the robot becomes completely perpendicular to the edge of the line.
